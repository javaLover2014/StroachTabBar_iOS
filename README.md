The StroachTabBar is a modern TabBar with a unique animation written in Swift. It is heavily inspired by [BATabBarController](https://github.com/antiguab/BATabBarController) but its implementation is more user-friendly. Because the StroachTabBarController is a subclass of UITabBarController it can be used without major code changes.

### Installation

StroachTabBarController is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'StroachTabBar_iOS', '~> 1.0.0-beta'
```

Run

```ruby
pod install
```

 and **import** it in your source code.

```swift
import StroachTabBar_iOS
```

### Usage

This is an instruction of how to use *StroachTabBarController* in the **Storyboard**.
1. Add a native UITabBarController to the storyboard as the initial view controller and establish relationships with its view controllers.

2. Change the class of the UITabBarController to StroachTabBarController.

   ![Add](./images/Add.tiff)

3. In the App Delegate cast the window.rootViewController to an instance of StroachTabBarController and add a StroachTabBarItem for every connected view controller.

   ```swift
   if let tabBarController = window?.rootViewController as? StroachTabBarController {
    let itemA = StroachTabBarItem(image: UIImage(named: "imageA")!);
    let itemB = StroachTabBarItem(image: UIImage(named: "imageB")!);
    tabBarController.stroachTabBar.items = [itemA, itemB];
   }
   ```

4. Customize the look and feel of the StroachTabBar.

   ```swift
   tabBarController.stroachTabBar.backgroundColor = UIColor.black;
   tabBarController.stroachTabBar.selectedColor = UIColor.orange;
   tabBarController.stroachTabBar.unselectedColor = UIColor.darkGray;
   ```
